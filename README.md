# Upcharge_GUI
GUI version of the Primo Upcharge Patch. Takes user input for selected establishments. 

#TODO Need to come back and write the README for this project. Similar to the regular upcharge project, just with reworking of various functions for use in GUI, taking input as a list of establishment numbers instead of a range, which is fed into GET functions and influences the ThreadPoolExecutor logic.
